    <div class="areas-text-container areas-text">
      <p class="reveal-box topic-sentence body-text">
        Besides my technical skills, I am interested in many technical areas 
        within Computer Science. 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <div class="first-interest body-text">
          First, I am interested in data science 
          because data is everywhere. For example, I am grateful to 
          work with Signify Health to use mock personal 
          data to create a system that has practically and tangibly affected 
          people’s lives. We live in a diverse world, and it is important 
          to create software that is accessible to everyone. These patients 
          could be unable to leave 
          their home for traditional healthcare for a variety of reasons. 
          Regardless, combining two powerful fields (computer science and 
          statistics) had a direct, positive impact on those patients.

          Second, 
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technological breakthrough that 
          will drastically affect the software industry with the rise of 
          generative AI coding tools. The combination of the popularity of 
          AI and the fact that I am interested in the linear algebra aspect 
          of machine learning make AI an intriguing field for me. To pursue 
          this interest, I am co-founding a mental health app with major 
          AI features.

        <div class="third-interest body-text">
          Finally, I am fascinated with software 
          engineering because I love programming. My dad was a software 
          engineer when I was younger, and learning about his experiences 
          inspired me to pursue this field. In addition, in elementary school, 
          I loved exploring Scratch, a block-based programming language; I 
          continued to explore this interest by learning HTML and CSS in 
          middle school, Python and Java in high school, and many more 
          programming languages in college.
